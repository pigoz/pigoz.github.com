hello,
======

I am Stefano Pigozzi, a programmer at Accenture Technology Solutions. At the moment, I am helping with the maintenance of the Siebel CRM installation of our client: I spend most of my time troubleshooting problems in the custom integration with other systems and writing PL/SQL procedures as contingency solutions.

I spend most of my free time between studying for my MSc in Computer Science and coding (mostly) in Ruby. Ruby is great: if you haven't yet, you should try it. Closures are everywhere and the Metaprogramming facilities are top notch. As you may suspect this makes for awesome libraries.
From time to time I will get dragged in some manga, anime or TV show. :)

I am the maintainer of *mplayerosx-builds* and *tankobon* this page while looking for them go on [my github profile](http://github.com/pigoz/).
