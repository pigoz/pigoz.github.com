Almost a month ago I started working at a new company (I finally work on Ruby, yay!). Since they gave me a Windows machine where I installed a Linux virtual machine, I wanted to keep my development environment as close as possible to my Mac at home. Enters Vim.

As everyone, I was target of a fair amount of buzz about vim, janus, less keystrokes, higher productivity and overall programming zen. I had a failed attempt at switching to vim in the last December. Unfortunately my work consisted in editing (PL/)SQL, so I spent most of my time editing in visual mode to pull off multiline edits: it was a real PITA for the kind of editing I was doing.

I have been using using Vim for about a week now and I'm really happy with it. Janus is helping me a lot, but the stuff that made the switch painless for me was watching the [Vim screencasts by Derek Wyatt](http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-novice-tutorial-videos): he is that awesome even if I still use the arrow keys sometimes...

Another very cool piece of software is [PeepOpen](http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen). Just set Vim to open files in the same window and edit the arglist and it becomes an awesome replacement for the Command-T plugin (which by the way is [crashing my gVim on Linux at work](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/issues/109)).

Just drink the kool-aid and start coding in Vim. :)
