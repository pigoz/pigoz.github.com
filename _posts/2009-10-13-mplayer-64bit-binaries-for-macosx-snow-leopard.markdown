I made the commitment to deliver updated binaries of [mplayer.git](http://repo.or.cz/w/mplayer.git) (64bit and Snow Leopard only). 
These binaries are designed to work with the [MPlayerOSX Extended GUI](http://mplayerosx.sttz.ch/).

The binaries are available on [the project page](http://code.google.com/p/mplayerosx-builds/) hosted on Google Code.
